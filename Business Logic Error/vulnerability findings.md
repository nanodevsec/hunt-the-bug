# 🧠 Business Logic Errors

Business logic vulnerabilities arise when the application behaves incorrectly due to flaws in the way it handles legitimate user actions. These are often missed by automated tools and require a deep understanding of how the application is supposed to function.

## 🔹 Common Techniques

### 🚫 1. Removing Parameters

> **Description:** Omitting certain parameters that influence how the backend logic behaves.  
> **Example:** A `role=admin` parameter may determine access level — removing it may grant unintended access if not properly checked.

---

### 🔁 2. Updating Already Submitted Values

> **Description:** Modifying or resubmitting already processed or stored values without proper validation.  
> **Example:** Submitting a second request to update a payment status without re-verifying permissions, possibly bypassing business rules.

---

### 🧪 3. Second-Order Submission Without Permission Checks

> **Description:** Exploiting the backend by submitting initial data, then triggering its processing later where permission checks are weak.  
> **Example:** First submit a post as a normal user, then use an admin-only endpoint to publish it without being admin.

## 🧰 Tips for Finding Business Logic Bugs

-   Think like a user _and_ a developer.
-   Question assumptions: "What if I do X before Y?"
-   Check multi-step processes for skipped validations.
-   Reuse objects, tokens, or IDs in unintended ways.
-   Try using old or stale session data.
-   Explore timing issues (e.g. race conditions).
